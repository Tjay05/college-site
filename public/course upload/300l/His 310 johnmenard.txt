Introduction
    John Maynard Keynes, 1st Baron Keynes,5 June 1883 – 21 April 1946), was an English economist and philosopher whose ideas fundamentally changed the theory and practice of macroeconomics and the economic policies of governments. Originally trained in mathematics, he built on and greatly refined earlier work on the causes of business cycles. One of the most influential economists of the 20th century, he produced writings that are the basis for the school of thought known as Keynesian economics, and its various offshoots. His ideas, reformulated as New Keynesianism, are fundamental to mainstream macroeconomics. He is known as the "father of macroeconomics".
    During the Great Depression of the 1930s, Keynes spearheaded a revolution in economic thinking, challenging the ideas of neoclassical economics that held that free markets would, in the short to medium term, automatically provide full employment, as long as workers were flexible in their wage demands. He argued that aggregate demand (total spending in the economy) determined the overall level of economic activity, and that inadequate aggregate demand could lead to prolonged periods of high unemployment, and since wages and labour costs are rigid downwards the economy will not automatically rebound to full employment.[10] Keynes advocated the use of fiscal and monetary policies to mitigate the adverse effects of economic recessions and depressions. He detailed these ideas in his magnum opus, The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money, published in early 1936. By the late 1930s, leading Western economies had begun adopting Keynes's policy recommendations. Almost all capitalist governments had done so by the end of the two decades following Keynes's death in 1946. As a leader of the British delegation, Keynes participated in the design of the international economic institutions established after the end of World War II but was overruled by the American delegation on several aspects.

Keynes's influence started to wane in the 1970s, partly as a result of the stagflation that plagued the Anglo-American economies during that decade, and partly because of criticism of Keynesian policies by Milton Friedman and other monetarists, who disputed the ability of government to favourably regulate the business cycle with fiscal policy.The advent of the global financial crisis of 2007–2008 sparked a resurgence in Keynesian thought. Keynesian economics provided the theoretical underpinning for economic policies undertaken in response to the financial crisis of 2007–2008 by President Barack Obama of the United States, Prime Minister Gordon Brown of the United Kingdom, and other heads of governments.
When Time magazine included Keynes among its Most Important People of the Century in 1999, it reported that "his radical idea that governments should spend money they don't have may have saved capitalism".The Economist has described Keynes as "Britain's most famous 20th-century economist".In addition to being an economist, Keynes was also a civil servant, a director of the Bank of England, and a part of the Bloomsbury Group of intellectuals.
     John Maynard Keynes defined economics as the study of the economy in terms of model and finding the relevant models and applying them to the real world problems. Unlike the classical economists, Keynes believed that government should play an important role in the working of the economy, when imbalances occur in the market.
       Keynesian economics is based on the idea that aggregate demand plays a crucial role in determining the level of economic activity. In times of economic downturn, Keynes argued that the government should increase spending to boost demand, which would in turn spur investment and job creation. This policy approach became known as demand-side economics.
Key contributions.
One of Keynes' key contributions to economic thought was the concept of the multiplier effect, which explains how an initial increase in government spending can lead to a larger overall increase in economic activity. Keynes believed that government spending could help to "prime the pump" of the economy during times of recession.

Keynes also famously criticized classical economic theory, which held that markets were self-regulating and would naturally reach equilibrium. Keynes argued that markets were prone to instability and that government intervention was necessary to prevent prolonged periods of unemployment and economic stagnation.
,British economist John Maynard Keynes spearheaded a revolution in economic thinking that overturned the then-prevailing idea that free markets would automatically provide full employment—that is, that everyone who wanted a job would have one as long as workers were flexible in their wage demands.
 John Maynard Keynes made several significant contributions to economic philosophy, fundamentally changing the way economists and policymakers think about the role of government in managing the economy. Some of his key contributions include:

1. The importance of aggregate demand: Keynes emphasized the role of aggregate demand (the total demand for goods and services in an economy) in determining the level of economic activity. He argued that fluctuations in aggregate demand could lead to periods of high unemployment and economic stagnation, and that government intervention was necessary to stabilize the economy.

2. The multiplier effect: Keynes introduced the concept of the multiplier effect, which explains how an initial increase in spending leads to a larger overall increase in economic activity. This concept played a crucial role in shaping Keynesian economic policy, as it provided a theoretical basis for government stimulus spending during economic downturns.

3. Critique of classical economics: Keynes challenged the prevailing economic orthodoxy of his time, which held that markets were self-regulating and would naturally reach equilibrium. He argued that markets were inherently unstable and that government intervention was needed to prevent or mitigate economic crises.

4. Theory of effective demand: Keynes developed the theory of effective demand, which posits that the level of economic activity is determined not just by the ability to supply goods and services, but also by the level of demand for those goods and services. This theory helped to explain why markets could fail to reach full employment on their own and why government intervention was sometimes necessary to boost demand.

5. Emphasis on uncertainty and expectations: Keynes recognized the role of uncertainty and expectations in shaping economic decisions and outcomes. He argued that economic actors do not have perfect knowledge of the future and that their decisions are often based on subjective expectations. This insight helped to shape modern theories of behavioral economics and finance.

Overall, Keynes' philosophical economic thoughts laid the foundation for Keynesian economics and continue to have a significant impact on economic theory and policy today. His ideas have been instrumental in shaping government responses to economic crises and in fostering a more nuanced understanding of the complexities of economic systems.
